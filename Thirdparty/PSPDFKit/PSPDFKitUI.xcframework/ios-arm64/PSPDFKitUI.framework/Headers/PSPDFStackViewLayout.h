/// # Subclassing
///
/// If you want to create your own document view layout, subclassing `PSPDFStackViewLayout`
/// is a good starting point. As long as you stick with the general idea that content
/// only expands in one direction, all you need to override to customize the layout
/// is the `layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPath:` method. It is used by the other methods
/// that deal with layout attributes.
///
/// If you just want to change the size of items, overriding `sizeForSpreadAtIndex:`
/// should be enough.
///
/// Make sure when overriding `layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPath:` to get the size
/// for each attribute from `sizeForSpreadAtIndex:` as other parts of the layout
/// are using this as well.

/// for the first item, the right inset will define the additional space after the
/// last item and the top and bottom insets will define the spacing to the edge of
/// the content size for each item.

/// spreads properly. If you override this, make sure to apply the `additionalContentInsets`
/// or otherwise setting additional content insets will have no effect.
